## Hello, I am Pat Woods

Hi there! I’m a career changer who used to be a classroom art teacher, now working in tech. Combining the two domains, I have over five years of working in customer support. I love it – I help empower people to get their tech things running and advise them in fixing various issues.

This site highlights some of the cool things I can share from my work in customer support. Other people sharing resolutions and approaches have helped me in the past, so hopefully, this site will help others.
