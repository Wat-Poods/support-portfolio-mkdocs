I can’t share all of the updates I’ve sent to customers, though there are plenty of cases where I’ve worked with customers via a public forum that I can share. Below are some of those interactions.

I currently work at Linode as a Customer Support Specialist. At Linode, Support Specialists can hold expert roles. These are somewhat like subject matter experts, trained in a way to help customers in a more specific way. One of my expert roles is being a Community Expert. It means I am expected to interact with customers and prospective customers in public forums outside of our proprietary ticketing system. The platforms that are included are our social media accounts, blog comments, [Community Questions site](https://www.linode.com/community/questions/) and our [IRC channel](https://webchat.oftc.net/?channels=linode). Below are some of the posts that I’m most proud of from our Community Questions site. You can see all of my posts by viewing the [user profile](https://www.linode.com/community/user/watrick).

Posts that I crafted in response to repeated situations where I saw an opportunity to provide a public post customers could find for common requests through tickets:

How do I upgrade my existing Ubuntu installation?
How should I handle a Scheduled Migration for my Linode?
I received a message that my Linode’s inbound traffic was exceeding a threshold. How do I check this traffic to locate the source?
I got a “Spam Report Notification” – what is this and what should I do?
My signup was flagged as “fraudulent behavior”

Below are additional posts where I’m proud of the interaction. The reason for being proud vary. It could be the research I put into it, the creative approach to finding the solution, or the tone I used in handling the situation.
