Aside from the support specific content I’ve published, I have written content for other reasons.

A blog I started is [Giving Flowers](http://www.givingflowers.online/). The intention with this blog is to express appreciation towards people who are currently around to hear those words of gratitude. Highlights from this blog so far include:

During the early part of my career transition, I documented my progress of self-directed learning and experiences though a blog. These experiences include reflections on early lessons about coding and describing some of my first experiences with attending Meetups and organizing my first hackathon.

The first time I attempted to blog in any way was by posting about my personal artwork while I was still an art teacher in the School District of Philadelphia. Initially, each post was meant as a way to feature the images, though I slowly explored writing in a longer form.
